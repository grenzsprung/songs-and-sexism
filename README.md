### [Project Description](doc/)

Term: Fall 2019
 
+ Project title: Sexism Revisited Or Why Our Kids Should Listen To Jazz
+ This project is conducted by Tim R. Schleicher

+ Project summary: This data story is a journey through the traces of sexism in our everyday music life. You will learn which genre might be best for your kids and whether the music you are listening to while driving your kids to school is as progressive as it sounds. By drawing on an analysis of sentiments and topics of songs across genres and time, this data story provides you with essential insights on how women are portrayed and talked about in music.

### Doc folder

[This](doc/0919_Sexism_Revisited_v1.Rmd) contains the RMD code for project 1

[This](doc/0919_Sexism_Revisited_v1.html) contains the HTML file for project 1

[This](doc/Sexism_Revisited_Text_Processing_v1.Rmd) contains the text processing code for project 1 which is very close to the starter code shared in advance. I just excluded several words like "she", "her", etc. from the stop words to be able to get songs about women later in the process

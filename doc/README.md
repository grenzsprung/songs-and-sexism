# ADS Project 1:  R Notebook on Lyrics Analysis

### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders.  

"0919_Sexism_Revisited_v1.Rmd" contains the RMD code for project 1

"0919_Sexism_Revisited_v1.html" contains the HTML file for project 1

"Sexism_Revisited_Text_Processing_v1" contains the text processing file for project 1 which is very close to the starter code shared in advance. I just excluded several words like "she", "her", etc. from the stop words to be able to get songs about women later in the process

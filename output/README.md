# ADS Project 1:  R Notebook on Lyrics Analysis

### Output folder

The output directory contains analysis output, processed datasets, logs, or other processed things.

[This](output/processed_lyrics_gender.RData) is the file with all songs lyrics I generated after pre-processing. In this file, "she", "her", etc. are not removed as stop words. I need these pronouns to later identify which songs are most about women.
